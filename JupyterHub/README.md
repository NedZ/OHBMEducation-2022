# JupyterHub for the Education Course
Will will be using a JupyterHub instance for the course in order to provide a common and comprehensive and accessible computing platform.

## Details
We will do a variant of the JupyterHub used by the [ABCD-ReproNim course](https://www.abcd-repronim.org/). The instructions they used can be found 
at https://github.com/ABCD-ReproNim/reprohub/.
