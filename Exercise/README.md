# The Publication Exercise for the course

# JuputerHub
JupyterHub provides the computational platform we will use. We can all use a common platform with all our needed software prerequeites 
and environment pre-set. This eliminates the hassle of making all this work on everyones local computers. However, the downside is that you 
may not be able to replicate this example 'at home' unless/until you solve the software prerequsites on your own computational platform.
That's OK, ***ReproNim*** is here to help after the course qith your own 'home' computational platform.

# The Steps
We will do our re-executable publication in a sequence of steps that are designed to accomplish all the necessary tasks in the timeframe allocated by our
course.

## Create a GitHub Repo for your Publication
In this case, our final publication will be in the form of a GitHub repository, where we can connect all the parts of our publication in a central, 
shared location. A GitHub reppo is FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoppoerable and Reusable. Sine this will be 'self published' nd not peer-reviewed, 
we really should think of this as a pre-print of our 'publication'. Were this an actual publication, we would create a mote focmal document, complying
with the norms of traditioanl scientific publication, and submit to a peer-reviewed journal (after depositing the preprint as well).

## Pre-Registration
In this case, we do have a specific set of hypotheses we are testing. In general, we *should* pre-register this plan (or consider a [registered report]()) 
but those steps are considered to be outside the scope of what we can accomplish in our time together. We highly recommend you read more about this 
topic [here]()

## Collect Data
In this case we will use pre-collected data. Specifically, each of you will be assigned a subset of the [OpenNeuro ds001907]() collection. 
[TODO: Add some more about thi dataset]. 

### Data Subset
Each student (or student group) will be assigned a subset of the above dataset for their analysis. This is both for practical purposes, as there is 
time to do only a limited amount of data analysis in this course, but also for didactic purposes, so that we can share (and aggregate) our individual 
results in support of both a *meta analysis* amongst our various subsets and a *mega analyis* by combining all of our individual results together. For our
purposes here, each student/team will get 5 randonly assigned typically developing subjects and 5 subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD).
